      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>. Â I&rsquo;m currently attending wake tech community  college in pursuit of a degree in cybersecurity. I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated  with computers. When I was a little kid, I used to mod Minecraft by going into  the game files and installing random mod folders that I found on the internet  and that&rsquo;s probably where my interest in computers started. </p>
